				<div class="Statement">

					<p>A river curving through a temperate forest, a sunbeam on a fern leads to a gradual unfolding of space and histories. An indigenous language linguist can be heard describing what he sees in Passamaquoddy, an endangered language from the Northeast, United States. The man-made elements are revealed. We see gardeners sweeping the river and meticulously grooming Murin-an, a 200-year old garden, created by political and military leader Yamagata Aritomo, one of the chief architects of modern Japan, who modeled the Japanese army after the Prussia military expansion system. He waged wars with nearby nations to transform Japan from an agricultural state to a modern industrial one, in order to prevent Japan from being colonized by Western countries.</p>

					<p>The property includes one of the first western-style houses and heating systems in Japan. Many of Japan’s early wars were planned within this structure. It is eventually revealed the linguist was previously a US marine stationed in Japan who believed in colonizing Japanese people as a way to help them but the experiences there led him to leave the military and to dedicate his life to preserving the Passamaquody language and culture. Although, 100-years apart, the work ties imperialism’s effect on a place and an individual and the act of preservation.
